# Risk Management

## Introduction 
Every project has possible risks that could become problematic at some point and jeopardize the project. To make sure it doesn't happen, this document has for purpose to regroup spotted possible risks and prepare a Mitigation Plan, ensuring project success.

> [!NOTE]
> This document can be updated anytime during the project, please check if you are on the latest commit.

## All Risks and Mitigation Plans 

> ### **1. Unexpected time management**
>  
> If time estimates are inaccurate or unexpected personal or project-related interruptions occur, it can lead to delays, rushed work, or missed milestones.

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> To mitigate this possible issue, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts and scheduling regular reviews allows adaptation to changes and stay on track without compromising quality.

---

> ### **2. Poor version control practices**
>  
> if changes aren’t committed regularly or branches aren’t managed properly, it can lead to code loss, merge conflicts, or difficulty tracking progress.

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> Committing changes frequently with clear messages, use branches for features or fixes, and regularly push to GitHub to ensure code is backed up and changes are traceable.



---
> ### **3. Inadequate risk management**
>  
> If a risk isn't identified and mitigated when it's needed it could lead to unexpected issues, delays or getting failures during the project.

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> Documented procedures like this document allows to identify, mitigate and manage risks efficiently. Maintaining regular self-checks and progress reviews ensures that potential risks are recognized early, addressed promptly, and tracked throughout the project lifecycle.



---
>### **4. Lack of clear documentation**
>
>If the project isn't well documented, it can be difficult to onboard future contributors, revisit the project after time away, or explain decisions made during development.

> ### Mitigation Plan
>
> Regular documentation writing allows disciplined recording decisions, features, and usage instructions. Maintaining a clear README, functional and technical specification, test plan, inline code comments, and update logs ensures that the project remains understandable and maintainable over time.



---
> ### **5. Motivation and burnout**
> Working solo can sometimes lead to loss of motivation,creative fatigue, or burnout, which affects productivity and project quality.

> ### Mitigation Plan
> To mitigate the risks, set smaller goals that are realistic and time-bound to create a sense of progress and accomplishment. Documenting milestones and regularly reviewing progress helps maintain motivation. Taking breaks and reflecting on achievements can also prevent burnout and keep the project moving forward with sustainable energy.



---
>### **6. Tunnel vision in problem-solving**
>
> Getting fixated on one approach or solution can lead to wasted time, over-complication, or missing better alternatives.

>### Mitigation Plan
>
> To mitigate the risks, set smaller goals that encourage stepping back to review the broader picture. Documenting challenges and possible alternatives helps create space for reflection. Taking short breaks can also prompt fresh perspectives and helps stay open to simpler, more effective solutions.
