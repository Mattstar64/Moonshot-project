## <u>Project : GameDev the Game</u> 

### Purpose

Game development is the most powerful creative field to me, however, learning it is a long process due to fragmented learning, overwhelming tools, and the lack of engaging resources. 

Traditional tutorials often focus on isolated topics, lack interactivity, and most of the time doesn't allow a creative process.

GameDev the Game as for purpose to transform how people learn game developmentâ€”by turning the learning process itself into an actual game. 
It will offer an immersive, story-driven experience where players build, fix, and design games while following a narrative. This approach not only teaches coding and design fundamentals but also fosters creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy in a way that feels natural, fun, and rewarding.

### Objectives

- Create an interactive, story-driven game that teaches the fundamentals of game development and coding.
  
- Develop a modular editor where players can experiment with game mechanics, music, art, and animation.
  
- Implement a mentor system that balances learning and creative freedom.
  
- Cover multiple game genres (platformer, RTS, RPG) across progressive chapters with increasing complexity.
  
- Include meaningful player choice, leading to multiple narrative endings.
  
- Optimize the game to run smoothly on low-performance PCs.
Release a playable prototype and progress toward a polished, full version.

### Project Specification
  
- In-game editor for simplified scripting, sprite creation, music sequencing, and level design.
  
- Mentor companion that offers adaptive guidance based on player behavior.
  
- Real-time testing, feedback systems, and error detection in coding tasks.

- Chapters are genre-based, each focusing on repairing, designing, or creating elements of a specific game type.

- 2D and 3D gameplay, depending of the genre.
   
- A Storyline that engage people to learn game development.

- Multiple endings shaped by how the player solves design and development challenges.
