## <u>Project : GameDev the Game</u> 

### Purpose

Game development is the most powerful creative field to me, however, learning it is a long process due to fragmented learning, overwhelming amount of tools, and the lack of engaging resources. 

Traditional tutorials often focus on isolated topics, lack interactivity, and most of the time doesn't allow a creative process.

GameDev the Game as for purpose to transform how people learn game development—by turning the learning process itself into an actual game. 
It will offer an immersive, story-driven experience where players build, fix, and design games while following a narrative. This approach not only teaches coding and design fundamentals but also fosters creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy in a way that feels natural, fun, and rewarding.

### Objectives

- Create an interactive, story-driven game that teaches the fundamentals of game development and coding.
  
- Develop a modular editor where players can experiment with game mechanics, music, art, and animation.
  
- Implement a mentor system that balances learning and creative freedom.
  
- Cover multiple game genres (platformer, RTS, RPG) across progressive chapters with increasing complexity.
  
- Include meaningful player choice, leading to multiple narrative endings.
  
- Optimize the game to run smoothly on low-performance PCs.
Release a playable prototype and progress toward a polished, full version.

### Project Specification
  
- In-game editor for simplified scripting, sprite creation, music sequencing, and level design.
  
- Mentor companion that offers adaptive guidance based on player behavior.
  
- Real-time testing, feedback systems, and error detection in coding tasks.

- Chapters are genre-based, each focusing on repairing, designing, or creating elements of a specific game type.

- 2D and 3D gameplay, depending of the genre.
   
- A Storyline that engage people to learn game development.

- Multiple endings shaped by how the player solves design and development challenges.
